# What is this and why should I be interested ?

>This project was started out of pure boredom.

It tries to interpret the assembly language used at the KIT's ("Karlsruher Institut fuer Technologie") GBI/TGI courses,
to teach the low level concepts of how computer processors work.
This program is very much a WIP.

If you are a student at said institute, this project might prove to be useful in helping you understand the basic concepts of assembly languages, or to "debug" code that you wrote for an assignment.
